# Strapi npm/node_modules Corruption Issue

## Problem
After installing dependencies (`npm install`), Strapi or its plugins (like `sanitize-html`, `htmlparser2`, etc.) may throw syntax errors such as:

```
Syntax Error
Error:   × Expected ';', '}' or <eof>
   ╭─[/admin/node_modules/sanitize-html/node_modules/htmlparser2/lib/index.ts:2:1]
```

Or you may find that files in `node_modules` are missing or contain invalid content (e.g., CSS/HTML instead of JS/TS).

## Causes
- Corrupted or incomplete `node_modules` due to failed/cancelled installs.
- Running `npm install` in the wrong directory.
- File system or permission issues on Windows.
- Antivirus or security software interfering with file creation.
- npm cache corruption.

## Solution
1. **Delete `node_modules` and lock file:**
   - `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json` (or use File Explorer on Windows)
2. **Clean npm cache:**
   - `npm cache clean --force`
3. **Reinstall dependencies:**
   - `npm install` (in the correct project directory)
4. **If issues persist:**
   - Temporarily disable antivirus/security software.
   - Ensure you have write permissions to the project folder.
   - Check for errors in the terminal output and resolve them.

## Notes
- Do not run `npm audit fix --force` unless you are prepared for breaking changes (e.g., Strapi v5 to v4 downgrade).
- Always run npm commands in the backend directory (e.g., `BlogGrid/blog-cms-backend`).
- If you see missing packages after install, check for errors and try again.
